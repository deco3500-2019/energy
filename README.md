## Cube prototype:

Arduino was used to create the energy consumption effect. The Arduino was connected to a strip of lights, visually showing the user the amount of energy they had consumed so far.

## Adobe XD Application:

To create an experience for the user, the application was made through Adobe XD, with minimalistic design and simple functions.

## Accompanied Set Goal Application

As Adobe XD does not support the 'set goals' function, this was done on another external website.
